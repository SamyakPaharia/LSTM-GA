# LSTM-Based Stock Market Price Prediction Model with Genetic Algorithm Optimization

This project presents an enhanced approach to stock market price prediction using an LSTM-based model optimized with a genetic algorithm. The model surpasses traditional LSTM models in terms of accuracy, offering a sophisticated tool for market analysis and forecasting.

## Features

- **Advanced LSTM Model**: Incorporates Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks, which are particularly suited for time-series prediction due to their ability to capture temporal dependencies.

- **Genetic Algorithm Optimization**: Utilizes genetic algorithms for hyperparameter tuning, significantly enhancing the model's predictive accuracy by optimizing complex parameters that are hard to fine-tune manually.

- **Python Libraries**: Employs a suite of Python libraries to streamline the development process:
  - `TensorFlow` and `Keras`: For constructing and training deep learning models.
  - `Pandas` and `NumPy`: For data preprocessing and manipulation.
  - `Scikit-learn`: For additional machine learning tools and metrics.

## Problem Solving and Innovation

The project demonstrates exceptional problem-solving skills by implementing genetic algorithms to effectively navigate the complex parameter space of LSTM networks. This innovation not only improves the model's performance but also contributes to the field of algorithmic trading and quantitative finance.
